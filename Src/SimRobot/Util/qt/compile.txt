A short guide on how to compile the Qt library with Visual Studio 2008:

Requirements:
  Visual Studio 2008 (Command Prompt)
  Cygwin
  some free disk space
  a lot of time

1. Download and unpack the package (e.g. qt-win-opensource-src-4.5.3.zip) to the path <builddir> (e.g. F:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.5.3)

2. Open the "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" and go to <builddir>.

3. Type: 

   configure.exe -release -opensource -fast -no-stl -no-qt3support -platform win32-msvc2008
	
4. *wait*

5. Type:
   
   nmake
   
6. *wait*

7. *wait*

8. *wait*

9. Done? The binaries (*.dll) and imports libraries (*.lib) are located at <builddir>\lib.

10. Actually the header files are located at <builddir>\include, but the files in this directory just point on other files somewhere in <builddir>\src. Therefore, i suggest to use the following script to create a working set of header files.

		#!/bin/bash

		pushd include &>/dev/null
		for dir in *; do 

		  if [ $dir == Qt3Support ]; then continue; fi

		  pushd $dir &>/dev/null
		  mkdir -p ../../exportedInclude/$dir
		  for name in *; do
			case $name in	  
				private) ;;
				*.pri) ;;
				*.h)
				  read wayne file < $name
				  cp $(echo $file | tr -d \") ../../exportedInclude/$dir
				  ;;
				*)
				  cp -R $name ../../exportedInclude/$dir
				  ;;
			esac
		  done
		  popd &>/dev/null

		done
		popd &>/dev/null
  
   Paste the script into <builddir>\exportInclude, open a cygwin shell, change the working directory to <builddir> and run the script using ./exportInclude.
   
   When the script has finished, the exported header files are located at <builddir>\exportedInclude.
