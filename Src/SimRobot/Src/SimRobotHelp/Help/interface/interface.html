<p>
The user interface of SimRobot has been designed to allow as much
visualization and interaction as possible, as well as to be flexible enough to handle
simulations of any different kind of environments. Therefore a tree of all objects
of the scene is the starting point for all user operations. Each node of that tree
may be selected to open a view for that kind of object. In case of actuators (e. g.
a hinge joint), a control for direct manipulation is opened. For sensors, several
different visualization modes are implemented. Through this concept, it is also
possible to open several views of arbitrary subsets of the scene graph. These views
offer a zoom, rotation, panning and different grades of detail as well as the
possibility to switch between the appearance and the physical model of single objects.
Furthermore, it is possible to interactively drag and drop and rotate objects inside
the scene or to apply a momentum to an object (e. g. to let a ball roll). This is quite
useful to arrange different settings while testing e. g. a robot behavior.
To add own views to a scene, an interface for user-defined views has been implemented
which enables the definition of own debug drawings from inside the controller.
Other elements of the user interface are an editor for the scene description
files and a console for text output from the controller.
