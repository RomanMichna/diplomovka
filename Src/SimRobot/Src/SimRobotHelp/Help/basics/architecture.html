As shown in Fig. 1, SimRobot consists of several modules that are linked
to one single application. This approach, which is diﬀerent from many other
client/server-based simulation concepts, has been chosen because it oﬀers the
possibility of halting or stepwise executing the whole simulation without any
concurrencies. It allows also a more comprehensive debugging of the executed
robot software.

The main components of SimRobot are:
</p>

<ul type="disc">

	<li><b>SimRobotCore</b><br>
		The simulation core, which may also be qualified as engine or
		kernel, is the most important part of the application. It models the robots
		and the environment, simulates sensor readings, and executes commands
		given by the controller or the user. Even most parts of the visualization are
		integrated into the simulation core.<br>		
		The kernel is platform independent. It is connected to a user interface and
		a controller via a well-defined interface. This enables an easy porting to
		other platforms as well as the embedding into other applications.<br>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>GUI</b><br>
		The user interface is responsible for the display of information (e. g. different
		views of the simulated scene) and for the interaction with the user. It is described
		in more detail in <a href="../basics/interface.html">User Interface</a> section.<br>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Controller</b><br>
		The controller implements a sense-think-act cycle. In each simulation step,
		it is called by the simulation, reads the available sensors, plans the
		next action, and sets the actuators to the desired states. A controller which
		is suitable for the modeled scene has to be provided by the user. Normally,
		it contains the control software of the simulated robots, but it may also be
		left empty.<br>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Scene</b><br>
		The specification of the robots and the environment, in the context of SimRobot named as
		scene, is modeled via an external XML file and loaded	at runtime. It is described
		in the <a href="specification.html">Specification of Robots</a>section.<br>
	</li>

</ul>
