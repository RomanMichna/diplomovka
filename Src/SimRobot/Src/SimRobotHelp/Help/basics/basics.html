When working with robots, the usage of a simulation is often of signiﬁcant importance.
On the one hand, it enables the evaluation of diﬀerent alternatives during the design
phase of robot systems and may therefore lead to better decisions and cost savings.
On the other hand, it supports the process of software development by providing an
replacement for robots that are currently not on hand (e. g. broken or used by another
person) or not able to endure long running experiments (e. g. learning tasks).
Furthermore, the execution of robot programs inside a simulator oﬀers the possibility
of directly debugging and testing them. This is a great beneﬁt when working with
platforms that do not oﬀer any direct debugging facilities.
