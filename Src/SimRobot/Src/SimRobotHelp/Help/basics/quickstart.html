<p>
To start working with SimRobot some scene must be opened (there are some pre-shipped scene
descriptions, look for details in <a href="../examples/examples.html">Examples</a> section).
</p>

<p>
When a simulation is opened for the first time, a scene graph, console and editor window
appear. All of them can be docked into the main window. Immediately after starting the simulation
using the Simulation/Start entry in the menu, the scene graph will appear in the scene
graph window. A scene view showing the simulation objects can be opened by double-clicking on scene
name. The view can be adjusted by using the context menu of the window or the toolbar.
</p>

<p>
After starting a simulation, a script file may automatically be executed, setting up the robot(s)
as desired. The name of the script file is the same as the name of the scene description file but
with the extension .con. Together with the ability of SimRobot to store the window layout, the
software can be configured to always start with a setup suitable for a certain task.
Although any object in the scene graph can be opened, only displaying certain entries in the
object tree makes sense, namely the scene, the objects in the group robots, and all information
views.
